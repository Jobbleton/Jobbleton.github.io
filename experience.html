			<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
			<p>
			My professional experience has been working in Information Technology (IT) for Gateway computer company and Tyson Foods.
			That experience has provided insight into how large 
			companies operate. I have thrived in that environment - quickly 
			rising to important roles in both companies.  In 
			both jobs I was providing technical support to users. Later at Tyson Foods, I would take on more critical roles by automating many 
			system support tasks.</p>
			
			<a name="independent"></a>
			<h3>Independent Experience</h3>
			<p>
			My independent work experience has taught me the value of self-discipline. This experience has greatly 
			enhanced my performance at Iowa State University (ISU). During this time I was an independent contractor, performing 
			a myriad of tasks. Most of my work was either technical support or programming projects. Beyond that, I also 
			tried my hand at construction and insurance sales. This broad exposure has also given me perspective that 
			helps me keep my priorities straight and see where my future work can fit in.
			</p>

			<a name="academic"></a>
			<h3>Academic Experience</h3>
			<p>
			My academic experience built on my prior IT experience. Throughout my time at ISU, I have been given additional IT work. Much more than 
			that, however, my academic work experience has broadened my horizons. I have worked on tasks ranging from building a tether-spool for a helium 
			balloon experiment, to programming microcontrollers, to instructing new engineering students on MATLAB programming. Constant new challenges have 
			kept my experience fresh and rewarding. This part of my experience has taken my vision of what is possible to new heights.
			</p>
			
			<a name="volunteer"></a>
			<h3>Volunteer Experience</h3>
			<p>
			Volunteer work has always had a special place in my heart. Even before earning my Eagle Scout award, I have seen the value in 
			helping those less fortunate. Through scouting and other non-profit work, I have done tasks ranging from building houses, to fixing 
			leaky roofs, to organizing blood drives, to cleaning up our highways. My volunteer work has taken me to foreign countries and inspired me 
			to learn new languages. Combined with my other experiences, my volunteer experience has taught me the value of giving back, and how to 
			make it count.
