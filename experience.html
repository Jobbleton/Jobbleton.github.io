Reflect on your 4-year experience at Iowa State University.  Remember to highlight things like your ability to communicate, utilize your engineering knowledge, and function within teams as well as what is highlighted below.  Here are some questions to answer as a part of your reflection: <br><br>

CR1. How do you think ISU has prepared you to: <br>
a. Design systems or processes?  -  Talk about object oriented design and education about diagrams<br>
b. Formulate and solve engineering problems?  -  Talk about team work and development<br>
c. Impact engineering solutions in a global/societal context?  -  Talk about social problems course, strong interest in philosophy and ethics<br><br>

CR2. What things have you done at ISU to prepare you to:<br>
a. Work in groups?  -  Many group projects<br>
b. Recognize contemporary issues?  -  working with company for project on current issue of mapping<br>
c. Understand professional and ethical responsibilities?  -  same as above, interview tours<br><br>

CR3. In class projects & problem solving tasks, did you draw upon information, research, or experiences beyond what was provided in class to successfully complete your work? Please state which resources you used here and how they helped you to complete work (e.g. library resources, specific professional journals, experts in field, other students).  -  codeschools, other students, professor discussions in databasing<br><br>

CR4. How did learning activities outside of the classroom (required 124.5 credits) – such as Student Orgs, Career or Study Abroad Fairs, Undergraduate Research Experience (REU), or other university programs – help you to understand the importance of Lifelong Learning?  -  Aerospace, Physics and Astronomy, Minecraft, Anime<br><br> 

CR5. Have you started to undertake any new learning to improve your ability to apply skills or knowledge to new problems and to develop confidence in taking risks? Please explain.  -  independent learning of new languages, relearning older languages to keep sharp like c#<br><br>

CR6. In the context of the first four questions, if you were to do your undergraduate work again, what things would you change?  -  focus more on getting internships, focus more on computer science, work towards optimization/algorithms, otherwise not much because I try hard to plan for the far future to prevent regretable experiences<br>
