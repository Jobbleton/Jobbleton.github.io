	<h2 align="center">Electives</h2>
	<div>
		Object-Oriented Analysis and Design<br>
		<p>Learned the ins and out of software diagramming, largely dealing with using and perfecting the usage of the Unified Modeling Language. Also where the Home Banking project came into being over many iterations.</p>
		Software Testing<br>
		<p>Learned about testing from the bottom up, from coverage to tools to huge existing tool suites.</p>
		Advanced Programming Techniques<br>
		<p>Learned c++ and its nuances.</p>
		Principles of Artificial Intelligence<br>
		<p>Absolutely fascinating course covering artificial inteligence and its applications. Intelligent agents, importances in efficiency for real time systems, various algorithm design, heuristics, psuedocode, challenging and engaging content nonstop. Ethical, temporal and geopolitical consequences are far-reaching and thrilling. Potentially my most favorite course I have ever taken in my many years being a student.</p>
		Embedded Systems I: Introduction<br>
		<p>Dealt with developing sensors on a Roomba-type robot in the c programming language. Completely rocked the final project with land surveying with what is basically limited echolocation.</p>
		Priciples of Microeconomics, and Principles of Macroeconomics<br>
		<p>2 courses I've taken lumped together for this description: I have done incredibly well in these courses and have a very good understanding of economics; overall and in-depth, widespread and limited, long-term and short-term, and in various meta-environments.</p>
