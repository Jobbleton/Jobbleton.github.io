	<h2 align="center">Goals</h2>
	<div>
		<h4>Short Term</h4>
		<p>Finish up college with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, then proceed as quickly as possible into an internship or entry position developing in Java and/or SQL (or various other languages listed in my resume), at a company that is inviting and productive. Specifics of the position are not necessary so long as the moral goal and work ethic of the entire operation is sound. Very flexible but ultimately working towards a humanitarian/progressive product.</p>
		<h4>Long Term</h4>
		<p>Working on developing predictive technology or intelligent agents that are better than a person at something, anything, that can remove the unneeded human element. If that is too far-reaching, then developing better algorithms for existing and facilitating maintenance and preservation of existing code bases through documentation and updating.</p>
	</div>
	<h2 align="center">Electives</h2>
	<div>
		<h4>Object-Oriented Analysis and Design</h4>
		<p>Learned the ins and out of software diagramming, largely dealing with using and perfecting models.</p>
		<h4>Software Testing</h4>
		<p>Learned about testing from the bottom up, all kinds of coverage.<br>
                <h4>Advanced Programming Techniques</h4>
		<p>Learned memory handling in real processes.</p>
		<h4>Principles of Artificial Intelligence</h4>
		<p>Absolutely fascinating course covering artificial inteligence and its applications. Potentially my most favorite course I have ever taken in my many years being a student.</p>
		<h4>Embedded Systems I: Introduction</h4>
		<p>Memory and sensor/actuator manipulation.</p>
		<h4>Priciples of Microeconomics, and Principles of Macroeconomics</h4>
		<p>2 courses I've taken lumped together for this description: I have done incredibly well in these courses and have a very good understanding of economics.</p>
        <h2 align="center">Specific Takeaways</h2>
	<div>
		<h4>Object-Oriented Analysis and Design</h4>
		<p>Learned about UML, and developed the Home Banking Project which taught me the importance of models and modularity on systems of any size.</p>
		<h4>Software Testing</h4>
		<p>Learned about coverage to tools to huge existing tool suites.</p>
		<h4>Advanced Programming Techniques</h4>
		<p>Learned c++ and its nuances.</p>
		<h4>Principles of Artificial Intelligence</h4>
		<p>Intelligent agents, importances in efficiency for real time systems, various algorithm design, heuristics, psuedocode, challenging and engaging content nonstop. Ethical, temporal and geopolitical consequences are far-reaching and thrilling.</p>
		<h4>Embedded Systems I: Introduction</h4>
		<p>Dealt with developing sensors on a Roomba-type robot in the c programming language. Completely rocked the final project with land surveying with what is basically limited echolocation.</p>
		<h4>Priciples of Microeconomics, and Principles of Macroeconomics</h4>
		<p>Economics coverage is total: overall and in-depth, widespread and limited, long-term and short-term, and in various meta-environments.</p>
