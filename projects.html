		each other's behalf, scheduling meetings and quickly and thoroughly
		resolving intercommunication issues. The site can be reached at

		<p>
		Fillthecup Games is a company my fiance and I started late 2017 where we are currently designing games for mobile. 
		We utilize Unity for prototypes and we do it more as a hobby. We collaborate through GitHub and Dsicord with colleagues and other local artists for resources and sprites, and we're having a blast.
