Reflect on your 4-year experience at Iowa State University.  Remember to highlight things like your ability to communicate, utilize your engineering knowledge, and function within teams as well as what is highlighted below.  Here are some questions to answer as a part of your reflection: <br><br>

CR1. How do you think ISU has prepared you to: <br>
a. Design systems or processes?<br>
b. Formulate and solve engineering problems?<br>
c. Impact engineering solutions in a global/societal context? <br><br>

CR2. What things have you done at ISU to prepare you to:<br>
a. Work in groups?<br>
b. Recognize contemporary issues?<br>
c. Understand professional and ethical responsibilities?<br><br>

CR3. In class projects & problem solving tasks, did you draw upon information, research, or experiences beyond what was provided in class to successfully complete your work? Please state which resources you used here and how they helped you to complete work (e.g. library resources, specific professional journals, experts in field, other students). <br><br>

CR4. How did learning activities outside of the classroom (required 124.5 credits) – such as Student Orgs, Career or Study Abroad Fairs, Undergraduate Research Experience (REU), or other university programs – help you to understand the importance of Lifelong Learning?<br><br> 

CR5. Have you started to undertake any new learning to improve your ability to apply skills or knowledge to new problems and to develop confidence in taking risks? Please explain.<br><br>

CR6. In the context of the first four questions, if you were to do your undergraduate work again, what things would you change? <br>
