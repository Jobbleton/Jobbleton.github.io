	<h3>Iowa State University Technical Preparedness</h3>
	<p>
During my four years at Iowa State University, I have gained a strong understanding of computer systems and processes, particularly through education in Object-Oriented Design and the classes about and frequent use of diagrams. Through many team and solo development engineering courses I have learned how to formulate, tackle, and solve various engineering problems- small and large. As a result from my breadth of experience in projects of all sizes, my world view has been broadened drastically and now constantly concern myself with how my decisions affect not only the product, but the consumer, society, and the world.
	</p>
	<h3>Iowa State University Humanities</h3>
	<p>
I have worked in eight official group projects and performed much unofficial collaborative education with my colleagues in single-developer courses when possible. Through collaboration with colleagues and upkeeping with news local, national and international, I keep an informed contemporary view of the world. I reworked two projects where the issues addressed were too far-reaching and not properly addressing current issues. I have a strong sense of ethical and professional responsibility, and always respect and take minutes in professional enviroments. This is a result of course practice and many professional tours of software locations.
	</p>
	<h3>External Education Resources</h3>
	<p>
For project/problem courses which required unfamiliar languages, I used and practiced with code school/stack overflow sites to partially guide my development. For algorithms and advanced techniques, and particularly so for artificial intelligence, I used library resources/scholarly articles dealing with similar ideas. For conceptual courses which heavily rely on lecture materials, I discussed and got plenty of supplemental assistance from teaching assistants and professor(s) through scheduled/unscheduled out-of-class discussions.
	</p>
	<h3>Out-of-class Experiences</h3>
	<p>
During career fairs, I was shown and appreciated the huge variety of opportunities for engineering, small and large companies, agricultural to urban, local to international, front to back-end, production to distribution, and obviously much more. For student orgs, I have been a part of Aerospace Engineering Club, Physics and Astronomy Club, Minecraft Club, and Anime Club. All of them I have an indescribable passion for in some way.
	</p>
	<h3>Independent Education</h3>
	<p>
For software, most of my independent education is in the form of learning new and relearning older but still important languages such as Python and C# respectively through code schools and implementations in school projects that do not directly require said languages but whose understanding of such languages helps immensely. Additionally, during education of algorithms and artificial intelligence, I spent much independent learning time on algorithms and learning methods not covered in courses, particularly interesting sorts/data storage and off-the-wall pathing algorithms.
