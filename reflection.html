<!--    <p>
Reflect on your 4-year experience at Iowa State University.  Remember to highlight things like your ability to communicate, utilize your engineering knowledge, and function within teams as well as what is highlighted below.  Here are some questions to answer as a part of your reflection: <br><br>

CR1. How do you think ISU has prepared you to: <br>
a. Design systems or processes?  -  Talk about object oriented design and education about diagrams<br>
b. Formulate and solve engineering problems?  -  Talk about team work and development<br>
c. Impact engineering solutions in a global/societal context?  -  Talk about social problems course, strong interest in philosophy and ethics<br><br>

CR2. What things have you done at ISU to prepare you to:<br>
a. Work in groups?  -  Many group projects<br>
b. Recognize contemporary issues?  -  working with company for project on current issue of mapping<br>
c. Understand professional and ethical responsibilities?  -  same as above, interview tours<br><br>

CR3. In class projects & problem solving tasks, did you draw upon information, research, or experiences beyond what was provided in class to successfully complete your work? Please state which resources you used here and how they helped you to complete work (e.g. library resources, specific professional journals, experts in field, other students).  -  codeschools, other students, professor discussions in databasing<br><br>

CR4. How did learning activities outside of the classroom (required 124.5 credits) – such as Student Orgs, Career or Study Abroad Fairs, Undergraduate Research Experience (REU), or other university programs – help you to understand the importance of Lifelong Learning?  -  Aerospace, Physics and Astronomy, Minecraft, Anime<br><br> 

CR5. Have you started to undertake any new learning to improve your ability to apply skills or knowledge to new problems and to develop confidence in taking risks? Please explain.  -  independent learning of new languages, relearning older languages to keep sharp like c#<br><br>

CR6. In the context of the first four questions, if you were to do your undergraduate work again, what things would you change?  -  focus more on getting internships, focus more on computer science, work towards optimization/algorithms, otherwise not much because I try hard to plan for the far future to prevent regretable experiences<br>

	<h3>Iowa State University Technical Preparedness</h3>
	<p>
During my four years at Iowa State University, I have gained a strong understanding of computer systems and processes, particularly through education in Object-Oriented Design and the classes about and frequent use of diagrams. Through many team and solo development engineering courses I have learned how to formulate, tackle, and solve various engineering problems- small and large. As a result from my breadth of experience in projects of all sizes, my world view has been broadened drastically and now constantly concern myself with how my decisions affect not only the product, but the consumer, society, and the world.
	</p>
	<h3>Iowa State University Humanities</h3>
	<p>
I have worked in eight official group projects and performed much unofficial collaborative education with my colleagues in single-developer courses when possible. Through collaboration with colleagues and upkeeping with news local, national and international, I keep an informed contemporary view of the world. I reworked two projects where the issues addressed were too far-reaching and not properly addressing current issues. I have a strong sense of ethical and professional responsibility, and always respect and take minutes in professional enviroments. This is a result of course practice and many professional tours of software locations.
	</p>
	<h3>External Education Resources</h3>
	<p>
For project/problem courses which required unfamiliar languages, I used and practiced with code school/stack overflow sites to partially guide my development. For algorithms and advanced techniques, and particularly so for artificial intelligence, I used library resources/scholarly articles dealing with similar ideas. For conceptual courses which heavily rely on lecture materials, I discussed and got plenty of supplemental assistance from teaching assistants and professor(s) through scheduled/unscheduled out-of-class discussions.
	</p>
	<h3>Out-of-class Experiences</h3>
	<p>
During career fairs, I was shown and appreciated the huge variety of opportunities for engineering, small and large companies, agricultural to urban, local to international, front to back-end, production to distribution, and obviously much more. For student orgs, I have been a part of Aerospace Engineering Club, Physics and Astronomy Club, Minecraft Club, and Anime Club. All of them I have an indescribable passion for in some way.
	</p>
	<h3>Independent Education</h3>
	<p>
For software, most of my independent education is in the form of learning new and relearning older but still important languages such as Python and C# respectively through code schools and implementations in school projects that do not directly require said languages but whose understanding of such languages helps immensely. Additionally, during education of algorithms and artificial intelligence, I spent much independent learnign time on algorithms and learning methods not covered in courses, particularly interesting sorts/data storage and off-the-wall pathing algorithms. Tangentially, I have independently learned how to bake, fry and steam delicious and unique food, as well as drive a motorcycle, play guitar and bass, pay bills, and form a well-budgeted balanced diet.
	</p>
	<h3>Soft Repentances</h3>
	<p>
I do not hold many regrets during my experience at Iowa State University, but I do believe I could have done certain things sooner or more efficiently. Namely, I should have started looking for internships sooner, and loosened my requirements for them. I would have also spent more time earlier on thinking about the importance of data structures and algorithm efficiency. But besides those, I would not change anything. I enjoyed my time here, and I thoroughly plan to ensure that I continue to enjoy myself and live life to its fullest.
